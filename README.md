# Path-Finder

**Path-Finder** is a visualization tool that shows how path-finding algorithms work on a 2D grid.

Submitted by: **Mykhailo Ivaniuk**

This is interactive visualization tool. Implemented features are available to user:

* [X] Choosing a starting place. To do that click on the empty board to set up start point, yellow square will appear indicating location of desired start
* [X] Choosing ending place. To do that click on the grid one more time, blue square will appear indicating location of desired end
* [X] Creating obstacles. Once user created start and end, they can make obstacles(black squares) by clicking on the grid.
* [X] Starting visualization for **A*** algorithm. Press **Space** button to start visualization
* [X] Starting visualization for **Dijkstra's** algorithm. Press button **'D'** to start visualization
* [X] Erasing start point, end point and obstacles. In order to manually erase anything press with two fingers on your Mac touchpad(right click for Windows)
* [X] Complete reset of the grid. To do so press **'C'** on the keyboard
* [X] Generating an obstacle map with predefined start and end positions. Press **M** on the keyboard and this map will appear.





## Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of some of the implemented features. 
First, the obstacle map was generated, then **A*** visualization started.

## Notes

Here are some additional details:
  1. Once visualization started, user cannot do anything until it finished.
  2. Visualization colors for A* and Dijkstra's Algorithm are different
  3. In order to start visualization user has to set start and end.
